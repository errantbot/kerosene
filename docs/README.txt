INSTALLATION
================================================================================
Kerosene is distributed as an installer named "kerosene-v.1.0.1.exe" and as a
zipped folder named "kerosene-v.1.0.1.zip". The installer, once launched,
will trigger a User Account Control request to authorize the program to make
changes to your computer. That is normal behaviour as the program has not been
digitally signed. Feel free to scan the installer to check it against viruses
and ensure that the program is harmless. Once you grant authorization, follow
the instructions; the installer will take care of everything for you.
To uninstall the program locate Kerosene's folder in your computer. It should
be located at C:\Kerosene. You should find Kerosene's uninstall program in there,
it is named "unins000.exe". It will take care of uninstall procedures for you.

The zipped folder version allows you to run Kerosene from any location in your
computer. Simply download the zipped folder, extract in a directory of your
choice and run by selecting the Kerosene.exe in the unzipped folder. You should
create a shortcut on your desktop to the Kerosene.exe executable for convenience.
To uninstall the program simply delete the folder and all of it's contents.
